            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>Mars is designed with large communities in mind. When you're the game master for a mission, you take on a big responsibility to deliver a fun experience to the players. Current implementations for real-time control don't offer enough detail and cause a lot of headaches when trying to do very specific things. The goal of Mars is to create a platform that's extensible and robust allowing communities to create their own additions and customise Mars to suit their needs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel-cbox-wide slideUp">
            <h1>Extensibility</h1>
            <p>Mars follows the same development environment and coding guidelines as <a href="http://ace3mod.com">ACE3</a> which not only makes it robust and modular, but also familiar. Mars is a mod for the Arma community as a whole. If you create an addition for Mars that could benefit others, you are expected to <a href="https://github.com/marseditor/mars/pulls">share it</a>. Creating additions that only apply to your group, for example calling functions from your own mission framework or modset etc. is a reasonable excuse to keep it private.</p>
