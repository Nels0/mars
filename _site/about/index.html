        <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Mars is designed with large communities in mind. When you’re the game master for a mission, you take on a big responsibility to deliver a fun experience to the players. Current implementations for real-time control don’t offer enough detail and cause a lot of headaches when trying to do very specific things. The goal of Mars is to create a platform that’s extensible and robust allowing communities to create their own additions and customise Mars to suit their needs.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>
<p>Mars follows the same development environment and coding guidelines as <a href="http://ace3mod.com/">ACE3</a> which not only makes it robust and modular, but also familiar. Mars is a community mod and by that I mean it is built for the Arma community as a whole. <strong>If you create an addition for the mod that could benefit others, you are expected to <a href="https://github.com/jameslkingsley/Mars/pulls">share it</a>.</strong> Creating additions that only apply to your group, for example calling functions from your own mission framework or modset etc. is a reasonable excuse to keep it private.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>You can help out with the ongoing development by looking for potential bugs in the code base, or by contributing new features. To contribute something to Mars, simply fork the <a href="https://github.com/jameslkingsley/Mars">repository</a> and submit your pull requests for review by other collaborators. Feel free to join our <a href="https://mars-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a> for help on setting up Mars and discussing its development.</p>
