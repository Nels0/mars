## First community test
Mars was kindly tested in a couple of communities recently; [ARCOMM](http://www.arcomm.co/) and [DDCA3](https://ddca3.com/). While still very buggy and not feature-complete, the feedback was mostly positive. There are some significant issues with FPS at the moment, where your game would freeze when highlighting units, but other than that it is currently a usable infantry controller.

Moving forward I definitely want more groups to try it out; the usability feedback is incredibly useful. The development process is ongoing so there will never be a final version - there are endless possibilities for what you can add to it (within the constraints of Arma). One thing I'm particularly excited about implementing is an `attachTo` system for when you need biplane dog fights with M2's. It's the little things in life, right?

Below you'll find some screenshots I took while using it with around 15 players and 2 headless clients. The AI were very responsive and setting up a mission on-the-go took less than 5 minutes. The players on the ground said the AI felt more aggressive than usual - certainly a step up from Zeus.

## Looking ahead
By the end of 2016 I'm hoping to have the FPS issues resolved and a much more stable build for groups to try out. There are still lots of AI commands to add, particularly for vehicles but now that the underlying framework is solid those _shouldn't_ take long to implement.

If you have an idea for Mars then feel free to post it on the [feature requests](https://github.com/marseditor/mars/issues/32). It's nice to be able to see the progress of the baseline features and what people are interested in most.

If you're not on Mars' Discord server then I urge you to [join](https://discord.gg/0vfzEmmrAOu1T2uk)! There's also a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marsmod) account for Mars now so I also urge you to follow that for sporadic updates and terrible attempts at humour.
